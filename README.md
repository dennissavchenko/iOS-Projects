# iOS App Projects ðŸ“±

This repository showcases a collection of iOS app projects that Iâ€™ve developed, each focusing on different aspects of mobile app development. From object recognition to fitness tracking, these projects demonstrate my skills in integrating machine learning models, working with APIs, using frameworks like AVFoundation and MapKit, and implementing clean architecture patterns like MVVM.

**Projects Included**:
- **Books App**: An iOS app for managing and organizing a personal book collection, with features like adding, editing, deleting, and filtering books via a custom C# server and Azure SQL database.
- **Airbnb**: A clone of the Airbnb app with a focus on replicating the design and user experience, including MapView and HorizonCalendar integration for reservations.
- **To-Do List App**: A minimalist to-do list app with task management features, including animations and sorting, built using MVVM and data persistence via UserDefaults.
- **Spotify**: A music player app that replicates the Spotify interface, allowing users to play, pause, and control tracks, while also fetching real-time lyrics.
- **Better Sleep**: An app that predicts optimal bedtimes using a Core ML model, based on user inputs like wake-up time, desired sleep duration, and coffee intake.
- **Image Generator App**: A simple app that generates images from user descriptions and sizes via the OpenAI API.
- **FitnessApp**: A health tracking app that fetches user data from the iPhoneâ€™s native Health app using HealthKit and displays it in a grid view.
- **ObjectDetection App**: An object detection app that uses the YOLOv3 Core ML model for real-time object recognition via AVFoundation.
- **Custom ObjectRecognition App**: A custom object recognition app that identifies specific objects (e.g., user, dog, plant) using a personalized Core ML model and displays confidence percentages.
- **Herbs App**: An app for managing a collection of herbs, allowing users to add and delete herbs with details like name, description, and image URL. The main features include data persistence using SwiftData and custom web image handling.

Each project emphasizes different technical aspects, including machine learning, camera integration, API usage, UI design, and data management. Feel free to explore the individual projects to learn more about my approach to iOS development.
